		<h3>Why Neighbourhood Farmer's ? </h3><br /><hr />
		<p class="text-justify" style="padding:5px;">Last few years has been
			revolutionary and people across the country have grown anxious over
			fruits and vegetables doused in pesticide. This has resulted in a gain
			in popularity in locally produced vegetables and fruits.
		</p>
		<p class="text-justify" style="padding:5px;">The main objective of
			Neighbourhood Farmer's is to support and encourage locally
			grown produces; be it from a home garden, family farm or from a larger
			one; be it Pappaya, Muringa, Chembu, Coconut, Guava, Milk, Banana leaves, etc etc. We understand that buying local produce strengthens our local economies, helps supporting family farms, and provides delicious fresh to our customers. </p>
