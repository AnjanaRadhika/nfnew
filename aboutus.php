		<h3>Why Neighbourhood Farmer's ? </h3><br /><hr />
		<p class="text-justify" style="padding:5px;">Last few years has been revolutionary and people across the country have grown anxious over fruits and vegetables doused in pesticide.
This has resulted in a gain in popularity in locally produced vegetables and fruits. We at Neighbourhoodfarmers understand this need and helps you search in your nearby localities called neighbourhoods. The search can be expanded to larger areas such as Village, Town, District, or State also.
		</p>
		<p class="text-justify" style="padding:5px;">The main objective of Neighbourhood Farmer's is to support and encourage locally grown produces; be it from a home garden,
family farm or from a larger one; be it Pappaya, Muringa, Chembu, Coconut, Guava, Milk, Banana leaves, etc etc.
We understand that buying local produces strengthens our local economies, helps supporting family farms, and provides delicious fresh to our customers.
